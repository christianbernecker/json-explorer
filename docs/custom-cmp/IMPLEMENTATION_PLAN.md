# TCF 2.0 CMP Implementation Plan

This document outlines the plan for implementing a Transparency and Consent Framework (TCF) 2.0 compliant Consent Management Platform (CMP) for the JSON Explorer application.

## Overview

We'll implement a custom TCF 2.0 compliant CMP by adapting the open-source Klaro library and extending it with TCF 2.0 compatibility. This approach provides:

1. Full control over UI/UX
2. TCF 2.0 compliance 
3. Minimal external dependencies
4. No recurring costs

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Setup and Basic Infrastructure (1 week)

1. **CMP Core Setup**
   - Install Klaro as base library: `npm install klaro`
   - Setup basic configuration and TCF 2.0 plugin integration
   - Create basic consent storage and retrieval mechanisms

2. **IAB Integration**
   - Register for IAB CMP ID
   - Implement TCF 2.0 Global Vendor List (GVL) loading and parsing
   - Add IAB consent string generation/parsing

3. **Environment Configuration**
   - Setup development and staging environments for testing
   - Create environment-specific configurations (test/staging/production)

### Phase 2: User Interface Development (1 week)

1. **Consent Modal UI**
   - Design and implement the main consent modal
   - Create purpose category selection UI
   - Add vendor selection list with search and filters

2. **Preference Configuration**
   - Build purpose description panels
   - Implement vendor details view
   - Create legitimate interest toggles

3. **Integration with App Theme**
   - Implement dark/light mode support
   - Ensure responsive design for all screen sizes
   - Add accessibility features (keyboard navigation, screen reader support)

### Phase 3: Core Functionality (1-2 weeks)

1. **Consent Management Logic**
   - Implement consent collection and storage
   - Add purpose and vendor consent logic
   - Create consent change detection and event system

2. **TCF 2.0 Compliance Features**
   - Add purpose and special feature handling
   - Implement legitimate interest signal mechanisms
   - Create publisher restrictions handling

3. **Integration with Third-party Services**
   - Implement consent checks for Google Analytics
   - Add cookie blocking mechanism for non-consented services
   - Create APIs for other scripts to check consent status

### Phase 4: Testing and Optimization (1 week)

1. **Compliance Testing**
   - Validate TCF 2.0 API implementation
   - Test consent string generation and parsing
   - Verify vendor list updates

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize bundle size
   - Implement lazy loading for vendor list
   - Add caching mechanisms for better performance

3. **Browser Compatibility Testing**
   - Test across major browsers
   - Verify mobile device compatibility
   - Check with various privacy settings and extensions

### Phase 5: Documentation and Deployment (3-5 days)

1. **Documentation**
   - Create internal documentation for developers
   - Add user documentation for privacy policy
   - Document consent APIs for future integrations

2. **Final Deployment**
   - Deploy to staging for final testing
   - Implement monitoring and tracking for CMP performance
   - Release to production with feature flags

## Technical Requirements

1. **Core Technologies**
   - React for UI components
   - TypeScript for type safety
   - Local Storage for consent persistence

2. **External Dependencies**
   - Klaro.js (with TCF plugin) - Open source consent manager
   - IAB TCF v2.0 API
   - Global Vendor List API

3. **Performance Targets**
   - Initial load: < 50KB additional bundle size
   - Rendering delay: < 200ms
   - Full load: < 2 seconds for consent modal

## Future Expansion (TCF 2.2)

Once the TCF 2.0 implementation is stable, we can plan for upgrading to TCF 2.2 by:

1. Updating the consent string format
2. Adding support for additional special features
3. Implementing additional vendor controls
4. Addressing any new UI requirements
